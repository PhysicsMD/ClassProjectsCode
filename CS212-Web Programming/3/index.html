    <p>To get a font working with a client server request you can do two methods. You can link the style sheet in you html file or you can download it onto your server and link it to the stylesheet in the local repositry which will use the font. For this project i used the font used for memorization and used SansForgetica, it uses the gaps to make the mind put together the letter and with the extra work it memorizes it better.</p>
